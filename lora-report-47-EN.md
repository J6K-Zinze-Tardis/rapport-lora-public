## 📣 Who this report is really for

This document is for **brave creative adventurers** held hostage by the CODE mandate, lost in the deep corridors of GitHub, and buried in the infernal twists of Visual Studio.

This beacon is like a lighthouse in the night for all those for whom code is neither a profession nor a passion.

**Know this: you did nothing wrong.**  
You came into this world to give birth to an idea, a project — to preserve a work, a vision, a fictional world, a travel log, a universe meant to be passed on.

And then, one thing led to another, and you found yourself in some kind of pitch-black underground boat, using your sneaker to paddle...

---

## 🎤 Introduction

This document is written for explorers, artists, dreamers, part-time coders, and full-time humans who one morning saw a black window appear... and almost never made it back up.

---

## 📉 Initial symptoms

It’s **9 AM somewhere in France** on your flat little planet.

Everything was going fine.

- I had my liter of coffee ready  
- Vitamins to the left of my keyboard  
- Focus meds to the right  
- My project and morning plan were crystal clear  
- Markdown files neatly arranged  
- Git repo synced  
- Visual Studio Code faithful  

And then — **BOOM** 💥 I notice a sneaky overnight Windows update...  

Not feeling too confident, I go for it anyway:  
→ VS Code restarts  
→ And then... **BAM!** A black window pops up.  

It's that freaking genie from the lamp yelling at me:

> **Windows Subsystem for Linux needs to be updated to continue.**  
> **Press any key to install.**

And me... with my coffee cup, in fetal position, and a leaky paddle... blinking at the screen...  
**What the hell is this?**

---

## ME NO UNDERSTAND.

You never asked to *"install a subsystem."*  
You just wanted to get back to your work.

But it’s too late.  
The demon is here.

By 9:01, you’re already thinking jumping out of the boat might be a better option than trying to fix the issue...

## 🧠 Post-incident analysis

The **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is a Linux box hidden in your Windows.  
You never needed it.  
You may have activated it by accident (or VS Code did it for you).  
VS Code remembered (and reactivated it after the Windows update).  
And everything restarted without your consent.

## 🔥 Risks encountered

- Technical panic  
- Mental freeze ("Did I break my project?")  
- Risk of giving up  
- Data loss  
- Invisible exhaustion and mental overload  

---

## 🛠️ Recovery procedure (summary)

1. Close Visual Studio Code  
2. Disable WSL via:  
   - `Windows + R` → type `optionalfeatures`  
   - Uncheck **Windows Subsystem for Linux**  
3. Clean up VS Code:  
   - Don’t reopen recent projects  
   - Delete `.vscode` folders, history, linked extensions  
4. Create a `.bat` shortcut to a clean working folder  
5. Breathe  
6. Resume  

---

## 🔍 Result

**Finally!**

The WSL demon is gone.  
The workshop reopens.

The terminal shuts its damn mouth.  
(And honestly? That’s a beautiful thing.)

I can finally put my creative hat back on.

Great.

**What time is it?**

Noon...?

**WHAT?!!!!**

### Morale of the story:

**None.**

You’ll paddle. And paddle again.

The good news is, you can always climb back up.
